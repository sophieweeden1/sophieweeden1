### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sophie, a Junior Front End Developer and Senior Technical Recruiter!

I started learning to code for fun during lockdown and I've been super excited by web development ever since! 
I worked my way through the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript with some Bootstrap and soon moved on to more intermediate to advanced JS. I'm now learning the ins + outs of React and I can't wait to keep building and see what's next....(Next.js????ðŸ‘€)

Besides coding I love weight lifting, cooking, and going to gigs and festivals as much as I possibly can!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and brushing up on some more advanced vanilla JS
